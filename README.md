# AUR: ttf-twemoji

The files for the `ttf-twemoji` AUR package.

This project builds Twemoji as a TrueType font. In particular, it is usable on modern Linux (either desktop or mobile) as well as other Unix-like distributions.

The build script here combines some patches from Fedora's package, the build system from Noto fonts, and Twemoji itself from Twitter. It is copied and modified from [whynothugo's repository at sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo/twemoji.ttf).

Builds are manually triggered when there are upstream releases.
